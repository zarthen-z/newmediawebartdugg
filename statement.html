    <h1>This is a Statement</h1>
    <p> <pre style="color: white;">
      The very concept of creating the unseen is somewhat of a 
      contradictory statement.<br>
      To create something, it must be seen, or else it begs the question, 
      has anything been created at all? Thinking about the concept more, 
      led me to find my idea that seems unseen, or at least, a very close 
      adjacent to unseen. <br>
      When a magician is doing a trick, the biggest part of pulling off the
      illusion is that they keep your sttention away from what they are really
      doing. Move a hand behind the ear, to reveal the quarter that pulled out
      their sleeve. They distract, and then act unseen. That is my goal, things
      may be obvious or seem to be quite 'seen' but like an amatuer magician, I'm
      just hiding things behind a show. So I implore you, the viewer, do not assume 
      that you are done with this experience because it is not immediately obvious.<br>
